asyn model 3 driver
-------------------
MCS2MotorDriver.cpp
MCS2MotorDriver.h
MCS2MotorSupport.dbd

MCS2 uses 1 step=1pm. Due to limitation in motor record of 32 bit int for RMP
this driver scales 1 step=1nm. See discription in header file.

Velocity and Acceration - I suggest to use zero (0) for both unless you really
need to set it. The MCS2 will drive at the default values.

Positioner types. This driver does not attempt to set the positioner type. I
have only type 300 stages and it works without configuration on my part. I'm
not sure if that's true for every positioner/sensor combination.

Only linear stages are supported right now (I have no rotary to test).
